#  Dataset Overview

# # Email: 
This is the customer's email address. It's a unique identifier for each customer and can be used for communication, such as sending order confirmations, newsletters, or personalized marketing offers. 

# # Address: 
This refers to the physical address of the customer. It's crucial for delivering products they've purchased. Additionally, address data can sometimes provide insights into geographical trends in sales and preferences. 

# # Avatar: 
This could be a digital representation or image chosen by the user. It might not directly impact sales or customer behaviour, but it can be a part of customer engagement strategies, adding a personal touch to user profiles. 

# # Average Session Length: 
The average duration of all session combined, in minutes. This is like measuring how long a customer spends in your store each time they visit. Imagine someone walking around, looking at products for, say, 33 minutes on average. 

# # Time on App: 
This the duration of presence on the store’s application, in minutes. Think of it as how long they're browsing through your app, maybe while they're on the bus or waiting in line at the coffee shop. 

# # Time on Website: 
Similar to the time on the app, but this is for your website. If they're using a computer at home or work to look at your store, how long do they stay? 

# # Length of Membership: 
How long these customers have been with your store. Some might be new, while others have been shopping with you for years. 

# # Yearly Amount Spent: 
This is the total amount of money each customer spends at your store in a year, in dollars.
