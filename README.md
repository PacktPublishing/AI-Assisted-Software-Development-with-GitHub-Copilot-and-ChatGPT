## About the book

AI-Assisted Programming for Web and Machine Learning shows you how to build applications and machine learning models and automate repetitive tasks.

Part 1 focuses on coding, from building a user interface to the backend. You’ll use prompts to create the appearance of an app using HTML, styling with CSS, adding behavior with JavaScript, and working with multiple viewports. Next, you’ll build a web API with Python and Flask and refactor the code to improve code readability. Part 1 ends with using GitHub Copilot to improve the maintainability and performance of existing code.

Part 2 provides a prompting toolkit for data science from data checking (inspecting data and creating distribution graphs and correlation matrices) to building and optimizing a neural network. You’ll use different prompt strategies for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, hyperparameter optimization, and model evaluation for various machine learning models and use cases.

The book closes with chapters on advanced techniques on GitHub Copilot and software agents. There are tips on code generation, debugging, and troubleshooting code. You’ll see how simpler and AI-powered agents work and discover tool calling.
